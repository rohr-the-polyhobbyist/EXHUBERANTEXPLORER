# EXUBERANTEXPLORER

## Project Overview

EXUBERANTEXPLORER is a project of education and fun. In this project, I will learn to use web APIs, possibly some web scraping, and eventually, some ML. While I don't have any intention to turn this project into a web application, that could be something I eventually like to do as well! Some ideas and checkpoints I hope to achieve:  
  
- Successfully connect with Scryfall's Web API to get MTG card data  
- Do something fun and basic with this data  
- Successfully web scrape some MTG commander format data from another source  
- Do something fun and basic with this data

## Features

- Pull Magic: The Gathering card data from Scryfall web API
  - Uses `requests` for HTTP requests
- ~~Web scraping of Magic: The Gathering card data~~
  - ~~Uses `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML~~
- ~~Data processing and analysis using embedding techniques~~
  - ~~Uses `numpy` for numerical operations~~
  - ~~Uses `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms~~

## Usage

This section is under revision as I settle on a project structure that makes sense. Currently, I am looking to replicate [this project structure](https://gist.github.com/ericmjl/27e50331f24db3e8f957d1fe7bbbe510?permalink_comment_id=5031342) to get started.
